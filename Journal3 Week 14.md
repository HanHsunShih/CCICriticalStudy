# Task 1
## What is literacy and what does it mean to call computer programming a literacy?( Before doing reading)
####
There are various ways to consider literacy, including the ability to read and write, as well as to communicate effectively through different forms of spoken and written language. This involves having proficiency in a particular language, along with skills such as critical thinking, reading comprehension, and problem-solving. Moreover, literacy can encompass a broader range of abilities, such as the capacity to use digital media, understand quantitative and numerical data, and take part in civic and cultural activities. Therefore, literacy is a crucial skill that permits people to participate in society, pursue their goals, and contribute to their communities.

I consider computer programming as a form of literacy implies recognizing it as a vital means of communication and expression, similar to reading and writing. This concept acknowledges that, in today's society, the ability to code and comprehend technology is increasingly essential and necessary for people to fully engage with the digital world. Like traditional literacy skills, computer programming literacy provides access to digital information and knowledge, which can unlock opportunities for creative problem-solving and the development of digital products and services. Moreover, it allows individuals to better understand and navigate the complex systems and technologies that shape our world.

# Task 2
## What are the new thoughts that come to you and help problematising the notion of coding literacy?  Which quotes or sentences inspire you to think more?( After doing reading)
####
Computer programming is no longer limited to its traditional functions such as software development, finance or engineering. It has transcended its boundaries and become a tool for communication, expression, and creativity. The concept of coding literacy is expanding, and one area of development that has gained prominence is live coding. Live coding involves the real-time creation of music and visual art through programming languages. It is an exciting and unique way to bridge the gap between technology and the performing arts.

Live coding can be seen as a performance art form, where the programmer creates music and visual art in front of an audience. The performer writes the code live on stage while the audience watches the process on a screen. This approach to coding provides an interactive experience for both the performer and the audience. It is a way to showcase the beauty of coding as a creative outlet and not just a tool for solving mathematical problems.

I love going to live band concerts. It's amazing when the two guitarists play together and it feels like they are having a conversation through their guitars. Their solos also depend on the vibe and atmosphere, so it's always a unique experience. Watching a live coding performance made me think of the concerts I've been to before. This new technology opens up a whole new world of possibilities for changing the way we perform.

Programming as a musical performance is a fascinating idea that has evolved over the years. It is a method of creating music using programming languages that can produce a range of sounds, from traditional instruments like piano and guitar to entirely new sounds. The beauty of live coding as a musical performance is that it allows the programmer to improvise and create music on the spot, creating a unique and one-of-a-kind experience for the audience. It can be seen as a new way of creating music that can open up new possibilities in the world of music.

Live coding is also an excellent creativity technique. The ability to create something out of code in real-time can spark new ideas and provide a unique perspective on problem-solving. It allows the programmer to explore new avenues of creativity and find new solutions to problems. This approach to coding provides a different way of thinking about programming, one that is not solely based on logical and analytical thinking, but rather on creative and intuitive thinking.

In conclusion, live coding is an innovative and exciting approach to programming that has opened up new avenues for creativity, expression, and communication. It has given programmers the ability to create music and visual art in real-time and perform it in front of an audience. It has also provided a unique perspective on problem-solving and has opened up new possibilities for creativity. As coding literacy continues to evolve, live coding will undoubtedly play a significant role in shaping the future of programming and the performing arts.
