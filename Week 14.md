Literacy can be considered in many different ways, like refers to the ability to read and write, as well as to understand and communicate effectively through various forms of written and spoken language. This can include proficiency in a particular language, as well as skills such as reading comprehension, critical thinking, and problem solving. Literacy can also encompass a broader set of competencies, including the ability to navigate digital media, understand numerical and quantitative information, and participate in civic and cultural life. In this sense, literacy is a fundamental skill that enables individuals to participate in society, pursue their goals and aspirations, and contribute to their communities.

To call computer programming a literacy means to consider it as an essential form of communication and expression that is similar to reading and writing. This notion recognizes that in today's society, the ability to code and understand technology is becoming increasingly important and is necessary for individuals to fully participate in the digital world. Just as traditional literacy skills provide access to written information and knowledge, computer programming literacy opens up opportunities for creative problem solving and the creation of digital products and services. It also enables individuals to better understand and navigate the complex systems and technologies that are shaping our world.
