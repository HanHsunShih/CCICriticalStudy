### Museum visit experience
As I walked through the exhibitions at the Design Museum, I was struck by the creativity and ingenuity on display. From the sleek curves of a Ferrari car to the bold graphic design of a poster, I was continually amazed by the talent and skill of the designers behind these works. The collections really showcase the diversity and breadth of design, from the functional to the beautiful, and I was left in awe of the designers' ability to turn their ideas into tangible objects.

One of the things that I found most fascinating was the exploration of design as a solution to real-world problems. This idea really resonated with me, as I've always seen design as a tool to make life better, not just to make things look pretty. The exhibitions highlighted the impact of design on our daily lives, from the products we use to the buildings we live in, and it was inspiring to see how designers are using their skills to tackle some of the biggest challenges of our time.

I was also struck by the role of culture and context in shaping our tastes and understanding of design. As Michel Foucault's philosophy suggests, our environment shapes our behavior and personalities, and this in turn affects our tastes and preferences. Seeing this idea explored in the exhibitions really helped me to appreciate how design is not just an isolated discipline, but is deeply connected to the world around us.

One of the things that stood out to me was the Museum's definition of design as being a creative problem-solving process. This definition highlights the important role that design plays in finding solutions to real-world problems, and it was fascinating to see this concept explored throughout the exhibitions. However, I couldn't help but feel that this definition oversimplifies the complexity of design and the multitude of approaches that designers can take.

In my opinion, design is much more than just a process of finding solutions to problems. Design is a multidisciplinary field that encompasses a wide range of practices, from product design to graphic design, and it involves a great deal of creativity, experimentation, and critical thinking. Design is also deeply connected to culture and context, and the way it is practiced can vary greatly depending on the designer's background, beliefs, and the cultural context in which they work.

So while I appreciate the Design Museum's focus on design as a problem-solving process, I also believe that it is important to acknowledge the full range of approaches and perspectives that make up the field of design. In this way, the Museum's definition could be seen as too limiting, and perhaps it could benefit from a more inclusive and nuanced approach.

Overall, visiting the Design Museum was a truly enriching experience. It opened my eyes to the power and potential of design, and left me feeling inspired and in awe of the talent and creativity of designers everywhere. I would highly recommend a visit to anyone interested in design and the impact of creativity on society.
